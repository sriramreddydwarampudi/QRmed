   - Double-click to run
   - Auto-installs Pillow if needed
   - Most user-friendly

3. generate_app_icon.py
   - Full-featured version
   - Detailed error handling
   - Best quality output
   - Requires Pillow: pip install Pillow

4. generate_icons.bat
   - Alternative batch wrapper
   - Finds Python automatically

CONFIGURATION UPDATED:
----------------------
✓ pubspec.yaml
  - Added flutter_launcher_icons configuration
  - Ready for icon generation

================================================================================
                    HOW TO APPLY THE FIX (3 STEPS)
================================================================================

STEP 1: INSTALL PILLOW (One-time setup)
========================================
In Command Prompt, run:

  pip install Pillow

This takes about 30 seconds and only needs to be done once.

STEP 2: GENERATE ICONS
======================
Choose ONE of these options:

Option A - Easiest (Double-click):
  → Double-click: run_icon_generator.bat
  → Wait for completion message
  → Icons are generated automatically

Option B - Command Line:
  → Open Command Prompt in project directory
  → Run: python quick_icon_gen.py
  → Wait for "Done!" message

Option C - Full Featured:
  → Run: python generate_app_icon.py
  → See detailed output
  → All icons generated

STEP 3: BUILD & TEST
====================
In Command Prompt, run:

  flutter clean
  flutter pub get
  flutter build apk --release

Then install and test:

  flutter install

Check that the app icon now shows the QR code icon (blue on white) 
instead of the default Flutter icon.

================================================================================
                    WHAT WILL BE CREATED
================================================================================

When you run the icon generator, it will create/update these files:

  android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher.png       (48×48)
  android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.png       (72×72)
  android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png      (96×96)
  android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxhdpi/ic_launcher.png     (144×144)
  android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.png    (192×192)

All with QR code style icon:
  - White background
  - Blue QR pattern (#2563EB - matches login screen)
  - Three corner markers
  - Center timing dot
  - Blue border frame

================================================================================
                    EXPECTED RESULTS
================================================================================

BEFORE FIX:
-----------
App launcher shows default Flutter icon (blue/white Flutter logo)

AFTER FIX:
----------
App launcher shows QR code icon (white background with blue QR pattern)
Icon matches the login screen's Icons.qr_code_scanner

Icon appears correctly on:
✓ Home screen launcher
✓ Android Settings > Apps
✓ File manager
✓ App store listings
✓ APK information

                    TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK REFERENCE
================================================================================

Issue: "Python not found"
  → Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
  → Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PIL'"
  → Run: pip install Pillow

Issue: Icon still shows old Flutter icon
  → Uninstall app from device
  → Run: flutter clean
  → Rebuild: flutter build apk --release
  → Reinstall app

Issue: Permission denied error
  → Run Command Prompt as Administrator
  → Or check folder permissions

Issue: Icon looks pixelated
  → Verify correct density was generated
  → Try regenerating: python quick_icon_gen.py
